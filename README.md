# Spree Nuisances

This gem fixes some strange issues in spree framework and extensions. We solve it here until they get solved offcially.

Note: Since this extension overrides other extension, please include this below other extension this has to over ride

## Features

1. Spree currency:
   Adds space between currency symbol and amount while using NPR
2. Spree Multi Vendor:
   With current version of `spree_multi_vendor`, you will get the error due to non existence of `vendor_path`. This gem has overriden that file.
